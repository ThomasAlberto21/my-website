# HTML Headings

Headings in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) are important elements used to mark title or important parts of the content of a web page. Heading elements are differentiated from <font color="#3cad6e">**H1** </font> to <font color="#3cad6e">**H6** </font>, with H1 having the highest level and H6 having the lowest level.

H1 is usually used for the main page title, while H2-H6 is used for subheadings or smaller sections. For example, H2 can be used for section titles of an article, while H3 is used for subsections within it. Proper use of headings not only helps users understand content structure, but is also important for search engine optimization (SEO).

By using appropriate heading elements, web developers can create web pages that are easier for readers and search engines to understand. Proper arrangement of heading elements also helps in maintaining the hierarchical structure of content, providing clear instructions on how information is organized and organized within a web page.

The following is an example of using heading elements in HTML from H1 to H6 :

```html title="index.html"
<h1>This Is Heading 1</h1>
<h2>This Is Heading 2</h2>
<h3>This Is Heading 3</h3>
<h4>This Is Heading 4</h4>
<h5>This Is Heading 5</h5>
<h6>This Is Heading 6</h6>
```

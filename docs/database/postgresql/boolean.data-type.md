# Boolean Data Type

The BOOLEAN data type in PostgreSQL describes a truth value that can be `TRUE`, `FALSE`. This is a simple data type that stores binary information, where the value `TRUE` represents truth or a true state, while `FALSE` represents a false state.

The BOOLEAN data type is useful in creating logical conditions, filters, and flow control settings in SQL statements. For example, in a table, a column with the BOOLEAN data type can indicate whether a statement is true or false. This data type also allows you to create functions or procedures that perform operations based on simple logical conditions.

With the BOOLEAN data type, you can compare truth values in SQL statements, for example in IF-ELSE conditions or in WHERE clauses to filter data based on given conditions.

# Enum Data Type

The `ENUM` data type in PostgreSQL is a data type that allows you to create a set of selectable values for a column in a table. This allows you to limit the values that can be entered into that column to a predefined set of values. `ENUM` can be used to simplify data management and maintenance by limiting valid value options.

In PostgreSQL, when you define a column with the `ENUM` data type, you define a list of valid values for that column. For example, you could define an `ENUM` for the column "sex" with values such as 'Male' and 'Female'. With this, the column will only accept one of the specified values.

The use of `ENUM` can help in ensuring data consistency because only certain values can be entered into a column, reducing the possibility of data input errors. However, please note that adding or changing `ENUM` values after the table has been created can be difficult, so it requires careful planning beforehand.
